                    I do a lot of things during my free time, <br>
                    but most of it is spent singing and learning new songs.<br>
                    Music calms me and gives me peace; it's like a place where<br>
                    I felt safe.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also spend a lot of time watching movies;<br>
                    it's not just for entertainment but also for learning.<br>
                    I watch movies with unique genres where I can learn<br>
                    something about investigation andÂ a lot more.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also love to cook and make new foods that I see <br>
                    on social media. Cooking and eating makes me happy.<br>
